### Description

The loan prediction system tackles the difficulties encountered by many financial institutions in efficiently evaluating and assessing a large amount of loan applications. Conventional approaches often involve time-consuming manual assessments which lead to a large backlog of pending applications causing delays and occasional bias, resulting in inconsistent decisions.

Our solution to this problem is to improve the process by using artificial intelligence. This involves using AI to predict the likelihood of loan approval based on previous customer behaviour and historical data.
